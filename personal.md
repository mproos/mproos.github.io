## This is where I talk about my personal interests


### Lifting

I love to lift heavy and I do powerlifting-style training.

My for now humble PRs are DL 105 kg x 1; SQUAT 65 kg x 2; BENCH 42.5 kg x 2 


### Dogs

I have a dog named Loki, who is an 8-ish year old large mutt I adopted from a local shelter. He is absolutely amazing, and like all dogs, the best dog in the world.

### Beers

My favourites are citrusy IPAs. In the future, I would love to try home brewing.
