## This is where I talk about my other projects

### Science in three minutes

Recently, I had the chance to participate in the "Science in three minutes" competition organized by the Estonian Academy of the Sciences. At a live event that was broadcast on Novaator (the leading popular science webpage in Estonia), I was declared the winner along with 4 other amazing your researchers. This experience was great and I will write more about it some other time.

### Abstractness and concreteness of Estonian words

Together with my colleague Mari Aigro, we launched a project to collect abstractness and concreteness ratings for 40 000 Estonian words. 

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
