## This is where I talk about my other projects

### Science in three minutes

Recently, I had the chance to participate in the "Science in three minutes" competition organized by the Estonian Academy of the Sciences. At a live event that was broadcast on Novaator (the leading popular science webpage in Estonia), I was declared the winner along with 4 other amazing your researchers. My talk was titled "Meaning as a tool for understanding the world". You can watch the whole event [here (in Estonian).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6c6n2M_Leg&feature=emb_title)

### Abstractness and concreteness of Estonian words

Together with my colleague Mari Aigro, we launched a project to collect abstractness and concreteness ratings for 40 000 Estonian words. Our ambitious goal is to gather data from 2000 native Estonian speakers - we're doing well so far! [Have a look at our website (in Estonian).](https://www.eestiabstraktsus.ee/)
