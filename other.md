## Ongoing things

### "Open doors" day at the university

On the 26th of February the University of Tartu will hold an "open doors" day for future students. Each institute is invited to hold a short workshop / information session to explain what they teach and research. I will be leading a workshop "Katsed keel(te)ga" ("Experiments with language(es)" - it sounds better in Estonian) where I will be introducing the Institute of Esonian and General Linguistics, with a focus on the various interesting experiments we run at our institute.

### Science in three minutes

Recently, I had the chance to participate in the "Science in three minutes" competition organized by the Estonian Academy of the Sciences. At a live event that was broadcast on Novaator (the leading popular science webpage in Estonia), I was declared the winner along with 4 other amazing young researchers. My talk was titled "Meaning as a tool for understanding the world". You can watch the whole event [here (in Estonian).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6c6n2M_Leg&feature=emb_title) Estonian National Television will produce clips with all of the winners, they will be played in the morning news / talkshow and viewers can choose their favourite!

### Organizing events in the Arts and Humanities Graduate School

As of Septmeber 2020, I am the event organizer in the Arts and Humanities Graduate School at the Tartu University. I am happy to be a part of a team that strives to make the whole PhD journey a successful one for all our graduate students. Together with the team we have launched a new event series "Junior researcher luncehon" and continuously organise workshops and study days for our students.

## Past things

#### Self-paced reading task (December 2020)

I participated in my supervisor Jane Klavan's project "The Making and Breaking of Models: Experimentally Validating Classification Models in Linguistics" and ran a self-paced reading task in UT-s lab. Results coming soon!

#### Eye-tracking task (December 2019 to February 2020)

I helped Nele Ots (Goethe University in Frankfurt am Mein) run an eye-tracking study in her project "Planning sentences and sentence intonation cross-linguistically". This was my first time using an eye-tracker, made me want to try it out for myself!

#### Organizing the ICLC-14 conference (Septmeber 2016 to July 2017)

In the summer of 2017 when I had just started my PhD in the fall semester of 2016, I was a part of the team organizing the 14th International Cognitive Linguistics Conference. My role as the conference secretary was to be there for all non-scientific tasks that were needed. I got to do so many different things and had the luck to work with an amazing organising team. Organising a conference with 500 guests from all over the world was definitely a challenge as a first year student, but I learned so much from it and I will never take a well organised conference for granted again.
