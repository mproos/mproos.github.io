#### What I'm doing now

I successfully defended my PhD dissertation on the 26th of March on Zoom! My dissertation is titled "Meaning and usage of Estonian experience perception verbs" and the title pretty much describes everything that is in it. In the dissertation, I focus on 5 Estonian experience perception verbs, their meaning and usage. The focus is on the polysemy of these verbs, as perception verbs have been shown to be polysemous across languages. To answer my research questions, I used both experimental methods (sorting task, conceptual feature rating task) and corpus-based methods (behavioral profile analysis) together with various statistical methods (hierarchical clustering, multidimensional scaling, random forests, mixed effects modelling).

It was a very interesting 4 years and I definitely grew a lot as a researcher - I feel ready to tip my toe into the real world!

#### Abstractness and concreteness of Estonian words

Along with finishing up my PhD and preparing for the defence, we recently launched a new project together with my colleague Mari Aigro. We aim to collect abstractness and concreteness ratings for 40 000 Estonian words. Our ambitious goal is to gather data from 2000 native Estonian speakers - we're doing well so far! [Have a look at our website (in Estonian).](https://www.eestiabstraktsus.ee/) This project is funded by the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research.

#### What's next?

Now I am looking to build upon my existing knowledge but also broaden my horizons. Going forward, I still want to focus my research on semantics. For me, semantics is undoubtedly the most interesting facet of language. From the time I started thinking about these things in the first years of my BA up until now, meaning has striked me as something so essential to our experience of the world but at the same time so elusive. That is what makes semantics so interesting to me - there is so much to discover! 

I am now starting the tedious task of finding a postdoc position where I can continue to grow as a linguist and deal with some topics close to my heart (or brain?). Some  topics that are currently floating around in the back of my head include: processing of polysemy, different dimensions of concepts (modality norms, abstractness-concreteness), polysemy and syntactic variation,  polysemy and the coding of arguments, ...
